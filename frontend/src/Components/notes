- look up how to have radio input button unclikc and click with react (states? maybe? idk maybe not)
- clean up your databas
- when you click true/false, a radio button to sleect a choice, or an option in an option list, update the state somehow with that response.

- clean database a bit
- add the oonClick to everything so the state gets updated with each choice
- add fourth type of quesiont, text input. reaserch how to do this. >>>>also look up how to update a state with an input in react<<<<<

- style questions a bit (NO MORE THAN 4 hours) google fonts, colors (page thme? background color? logo? style the menu? etc.) code pen!    
- maybe try to start home page (make a home component and then import it into app.js)
